Click "New Note" button to create a new note

Type in a title in the title input box, and type in text in the text area beneath

Click the save button, only once, otherwise more than one ID will be associated with the note and I'm not sure how that will effect the program

Repeat the first 3 steps as many times as you'd like.

Click on each note on the left side to bring up the note's contents on the right side

All notes will be gone upon closing the browser as I'm using sessionStorage to store the data.
